Before assembling this product, please be sure to spend a few minutes to learn about this product description, thank you! Spot welding machine products are semi-fini shed circuit boards, so you need to have certain electricity knowledge and practical a bility, and also need to prepare some necessary tools. Buch as: multimeter, pliers, so rew cutter, eto.

Spot welder accessories include

1. Control board #1 2. Super soft silicone input cable 2 (The aircraft model battery version is without i

nput line, and the startup treasure version is the EC5 female input line)

3. Super soft silicone output cable with spot welding pen*2

4. Screws, several heat-shrinkable sleeves.

5 Free: About one meter of nickel sheet for practice




Notice! the red spot welding pen is charged, don't use it to touch any components on the board. Do not replace or extend the cable without authorization, Do not use clamps for wiring, which will cause current limitation and the spot welding effect will be unsatisfac tory. After the user receive it. the wiring shall be operated strictly in accordance with

the instructions, and the reverse connection will cause the burning of the components. The power supply shall be strictly in accordance with the requirements. Over voltage and over current are prohibited. Power supply: self

provided power supply 1. Lead acid battery version is suitable for: The old lead-acid battery 12V 20Ah 100Ah (the new battery can not exceed 45Ah, if it exceeds 45Ah contact the customer service to consult the current limiting method

toavoid damaging the welding machine) 20Ah can not exceed 1 year. If exceed will require large capacity. Or: 4-5 series super Faraday capacitors Or large monomer (iron lithium battery)

2. Aircraft model battery version: 35-45 250-600 XT60 connector. The line of aircraft a odel battery shall not be less than 6 square meters 3. Startup treasure version: the 12V startup treasure that can normally start the car w hich must have ECS interface. 4. The requirements of compatible version are the same as above, and one of them can be selected for power supply

If it is not within the requirements, no other power supply is allowed

Do not use lithium battery, switching power supply, transformer, charger, water battery or charging treasure to supply power to the spot welder. Or will damage the bo ard of the spot welder After receiving it, the user should strictly follow the instructions for wiring, otherwi se the components will be burned. Power supply strictly in accordance with the ts, prohibit overvoltage and overcurrent. Control panel working voltage 9-16V, current 90-160A. if you don't understand, you can consult customer service at any time.

Special warning for K99 type spot welding machine: If the operation is not standardized. it will cause damage to the components of the control board. Because the gear of this type of epot welding machine is super high, the power supply is strictly in accordance with our required parameters. The position should be from low to high, and it is forbid den to increase the high-grade position. It needs to increase the 0-1-2-3 gears in aequ ence, and the positive and negative poles cannot be reversed!

Instructions for spot welder

1. Key function: on/off switch on/off: "+" key: increase gear: -" key decrease 2. This spot welding machine control board adopts five MOS tubes produced by Infineon co mpany in Germany. The maximum current of a single MOS tube is more than 400A. after f ive MDS tubes are connected in parallel, the theoretical maximum current can reach mo re than 2000A. the gear in 0-99, the lowest in gear 1 and the highest in gear 99. dur ing first use, if you don't know the discharge capacity of your own battery, it is re

commended to increase the gear by 0-1-2 in sequence, and you can't skip the level. 0- 20-30 is easy to burn the control board; If the thickness of spot welded nickel sheet is 0.1-0. 12. It is recommended to adjust th gear time to about 5-15. If the thickness is 0.15-0.2, it is recommended to adjust the gear time to about 15-30, which is specifically related to the discharge capacity of the ir respective batteries. For new batteries and batteries purchased for less than half a year, the recommended gear setting should not exceed 30.

Note: Do not use force when spot welding, just touch it lightly. The spot welding pen is slightly tilted and stays for 2 seconds, it will automatically trigger the spot welding There are five NOS tube positions reserved on the back, which is convenient for buyers W ho are familiar with hands-on ability to add NOS tubes by themselves and increase the fu n of DIY
